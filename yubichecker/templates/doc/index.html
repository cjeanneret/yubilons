<h4>Personalize your Yubikey</h4>
<p>Yubico provides some tools allowing you to reconfigure your Yubikey. Please refer to their documentation: <a href="http://yubico.com/developers/personalization/">Personalization Tool</a>.</p>

<p>For Linux users, here's a simple script which can help you. You'll have to install some tools before.</p>

<h4>Server answers</h4>
We have several answer code. Most of them are Status 200, and a text output which is really easy to parse.<br />
<ul>
  <li>Server answers 404: That means we don't have find any AES key attached to your public ID</li>
  <li>Server answers 203: That means either
    <ul>
      <li>your signature is bad</li>
      <li>or your private id isn't correct</li>
      <li>or your AES key are bad.</li>
    </ul>
    In the two last cases, please contact us
  </li>
  <li>Server answers 200: You can parse the output, and know what exactly happens</li>
</ul>

<h4>Sign your request</h4>
To sign your request, you'll have to do as follow:
<pre>
#!/usr/bin/env python
import hmac, base64
from hashlib import sha512

key = AES
s = 'otp=OTP'

args = hmac.new(key, s, digestmod=sha512)
sign = base64.b64encode(args.digest())
print sign
</pre>

<h4>To verify our signature</h4>
You just have to encrypt the content of our answer in the same way, and to compare signatures. Example:<br />
Our answer:
<pre>
status=OK
t=TIMESTAMP
h=SIGN
</pre>
You'll take the first two lines, with the linebreak, encode it, and compare with SIGN.
